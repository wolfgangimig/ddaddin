- Assume COPY effect by default if Outlook item is dropped into another application. 
  This prevents Outlook from moving an item into the folder of deleted item after it is dropped
  into another application. The behavior was observed by a customer with
  Outlook 2010, Windows 10 and Firefox 47.0 (48.0): mails dragged into Firefox were moved into
  the folder of deleted items. 
  In order to allow Outlook items being moved, set Registry value 
  IgnoreTargetEffectIfDroppedIntoOtherApplication="false".
