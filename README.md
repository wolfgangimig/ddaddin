# DDAddin
DDAddin is a Microsoft Outlook Addin that allows to drag and drop mails, attachments, etc. from Outlook into HTML5 web pages and other applications.

Web browsers do not recognize Outlook's special drag and drop data format. That's why mails, attachments, calendar items or notes cannot be dragged from Outlook into a HTML web site.

DDAddin converts Outlook's data format into the standard format for file drop operations. So Outlook items drag-dropped or copy-pasted can be processed e.g. with HTML5 file API functions.

DDAddin not only supports Web browsers. It also helps to transfer items to all other applications that do not implement Outlook's format - e.g. Java applications.

Outlook 2010 and 2013 on all Windows versions from XP to Windows 10 (Beta) are supported.

DDAddin is a commercial product which is available for download at http://www.wilutions.com/ddaddin/download.html.
This GitHub repositiory provides documentation and issue tracking for this product.
